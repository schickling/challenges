I open up a Word document and type all the numbers 1-10000, separated by spaces, (I did not use any 'thousands' punctuation; just raw numbers).

Then, my daughter came along and used search and replace, and changed all the digits '0' into spaces. If I now sum up all the numbers in the document what is the total? (Any number delineated by one or more spaces is a distinct number).
