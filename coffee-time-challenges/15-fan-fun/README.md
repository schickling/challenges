This is not a programming challange, but a logic challenge.

## Story
You’re taking care of a friend’s house whilst he’s on vacation.
In one room you pull the chain on a ceiling fan, and when it doesn’t respond
you realize the house has temporarily lost power.

Doh!

Unfortunately, you have to leave now, and you'll be away for several days.

You know that the fan was in the “off” position before you pulled the chain,
and that pulling the chain successively will cycle it through its remaining
settings (“off,” “high”, “medium”. etc.). You don’t know how many settings
there are, but you are sure there aren’t more than four.

How can you ensure the fan will be in the “off” positions when power is
restored?
